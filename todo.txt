LATER: 
Manage jslint better so no possible global vraiable name collisions. Investigate jshint instead or in addition. 

Autosuite should merge, not clobber, other suites.

AutoSuite:  Support exclusion regex. GLOBAL, LOCAL, BOTH?

Does manual suite make sense anymore? Vis. deadcode.

Integrate with mocha node tests that need the server side. teehee.

MEDIUM

SOON:

Style the multiview pass/fail table

Display the details of the first lint and spec failure automatically

Scroll box for the iframe child div?

Clean up aux directory. Explain what parts can't be tested and why.
Put server side only stuff in a different place.

dead code view for suites; report in multiview suite grid. Need more
thinking there. Ought to flag code that has no corresponding unit test suite.

Run dead code against lint.

general exception list

Global variable report--where declared and used, where declared and not used.

fail mode for multiview

link from suite page to multi page

General catastrophic error handling:
        module load failure
        suite name incorrect
        parse error in Spec code
        
phantom does not wait for lint to finish
