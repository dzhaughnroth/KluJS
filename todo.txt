Only use Backbone and _ in noConflict mode. Do not contaminate the module namespace with "backbone" and "underscore"

Backbone in noConflict is ok.

Underscore decides to define itself under the AMD module name
underscore, not the path to the library. So I don't think we can avoid
taking over the AMD namespace. However, a library can use a different
name for underscore, and will not get that one. I don't think.
