Document/enhance filters for modules and files.

Create build/Minification process for distributing KluJS

Use klujs-config to generate build process for projects.

clear jscoverage at start of specrunner no wait then they can't they
run concurrently maybe that's okay how do we force it?

Document configuration.

Make the proxy restart process automatically.

Remove jasmineGradle global, probably unused. Limit klujs global to
configuration; use a module to access it.

Report better on lint filtering. And, in particular, don't report
KluJS being filtered out, if it is.

"src" optional custom setting is probably unnecessary if we do not use
jscoverage as the server for uninstrumented files. So do that.

Overrides for main,test,libDirs should be relative to src and each
other? Or templating like "${main}/lib"?

Provide way to view settings on result page. That means showing both
supplied and computed settings.

Too many ".." in paths; compute to essence.

Remove dependency on console logging to detect completion.

Provide way to rerun lint, but not tests.

Provide way to measure coverage per-suite or per-spec. I think this
is important at the moment, more important than speed.

Oh and the UI stinks.

Provide a way to specify coverage targets.

fix bug where specs are filtered because path is KluJS/../../pathToTest...
